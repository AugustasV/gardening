# Spinnaker-Gardening #CommunityHack

Move the needle on continuous delivery projects at Spinnaker Gardening Days #communityHack, sponsored by SalesForce! Join user companies to learn and let your skills shine at this collaborative hackathon. Weâ€™ll address open-source feature requirements and extend the ecosystem.

## What is this?
This is documentation for Spinnaker Gardening Days #communityHack, a series of open-source Spinnaker hackathons open to anyone in the community, including newcomers. The goal of this doc is to set expectations and help you get started.

## When is the event?
The first event will take place online on April 9 & 10, 2020.

## How should I prepare to participate in Spinnaker Gardening?
1. Register for the event here [link tbd](example.com)
2. [Join Spinnaker Slack](join.spinnaker.io) and join the following channels:
    * **#gardening-general**   Make general, public conversation. Please use threads for (welcome!) jokes and side convos
    * **#gardening-ineedhelp**   Request help here from experts during the hackathon, or ask setup questions before it starts.
3. Ask for your organization to "sponsor" your time at the event. [Use this flyer](https://s.armory.io/v1ur0KQQ) to highlight the benefits of participating.
4. Visit the [Project Ideas Hackpad](https://github.com/spinnaker-hackathon/gardening/wiki/Project-Ideas) in the gardening wiki. 
   * Review the ideas. If you have follow-up ideas, questions, or enthusiasm for an idea, join the listed __#gardening-idea-XXXXXX__ channel in Slack to discuss it.
   * If you have a project idea, follow the instructions to add it. Then go to Spinnaker Slack and create the Channel Name you specified. 
5. Leverage our "Day Zero" materials. We will announce in **#gardening-general** and publish the links on this page when they are available. The Workshops will be ready the week prior to the hackathon. We'll also host office hours on the day before the hackathon starts; you can ask for help there or in Slack.
