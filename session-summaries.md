## July 16th Kickoff Session

[Recap Video](https://youtu.be/k4-rBm3LZAo)

Sad news first: there is no video from this session, as we had some technical difficulties with our kickoff Zoom call. [Watch the recap we recorded](https://youtu.be/k4-rBm3LZAo), and here's a summary of what we discussed:
- [Spinnaker Slack](https://join.spinnaker.io) and GitHub accounts are required for full participation in Gardening Days.
- To check in to Spinnaker Gardening Days and have your GitHub handle added to the [Contribution Tracking doc](https://go.armory.io/contributors) and this organization, please use [this check-in link](https://go.armory.io/gardening-checkin). When you check in, you will also provide the address to which we should send your swag and prize(s).
- Big thank you to our compute sponsor, AWS! Thanks to AWS, we are able to provide free compute for hackathon participants in a managed environment. You can [read more about training and development environments](README.md#training-and-development-environments) below.
- Spinnaker Gardening Days is a hackathon where attendees are forming teams to work on Spinnaker projects of their choice, and/or making individual contributions to the project.
  - Team projects with output to demo will be judged by our team of experts (on-call gardeners and match advisors), and winners will be chosen in each [challenge category](README.md#team-challenges).
    - Teams and challenges are not set in stone, and it is OK for participants to form new teams, propose projects, and engage with multiple teams to find the right fit. Just be courteous.
    - Two of our SIGs are sponsoring teams: 
      - Ops SIG is working on dynamic accounts automation. Visit #sig-ops to get involved!
      - Security SIG is working on threat models. You don't need to be a security expert to add value. Visit #sig-security to get involved!
  - Individual contributions include but are not limited to [the ideas on this list](https://spinnaker.io/community/gardening/what-to-hack/). Each contribution is worth one point, and attendees will earn prizes by reaching different [points thresholds](README.md#prizes). __Contributions that are GitHub events will be counted with no additional action from you__ and should appear on the [tracking doc](go.armory.io/contributors) once the batch is processed. When you make other contributions, such as community content (videos, blog posts, Twitch streams) and StackOverflow posts, you will need to post your evidence/link(s) into [#gardening-general](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/archives/CV4A90DPF) to receive credit. If non-code contributions were a team effort, tag all participants in the post so that everyone receives points. 
  - A few tips on content contributions:
    - If you are making __video content__, playlists of shorter videos will earn you more points than single long videos. These are easier for viewers to consume.
    - To write a __blog post__ with the intent of posting it on the [Spinnaker Community Blog](https://blog.spinnaker.io/), it will be easiest to write it as a Medium post. Event organizers can get your approved blog posts added to the community blog. You are also free to post on your personal or company blog. Ping in [#gardening-general](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/archives/CV4A90DPF) if you need assistance duplicating an external blog post on the community blog.
    - There is a ton of cool new content in the [videos from Spinnaker.Live](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4yLrwUObNkvO80Bjln8_DJXxQNSYrtEs). Watch them, and better yet, write a tech blog about one of the presentations, or an article based on one of the keynotes, enterprise use cases, or panels.
    - The types of content and contributions you can make are not limited to organizer imaginations. If there is something you'd like to contribute and it hasn't been mentioned, please share in [#gardening-general](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/archives/CV4A90DPF) to discuss eligibility.
  - A few ideas for GitHub event contributions:
    - One cool proposed idea is [adding Kayenta support for CloudWatch](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/issues/5888).
    - Another exciting idea: [adding support for Microsoft Teams notifications to Echo](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/issues/5826)
    - Join #sig-documentation to help with some exciting projects happening around [spinnaker.io](https://www.spinnaker.io). Ask the SIG how you can help with the Spinnaker refresh project! One great contribution would be to help writing high-quality short descriptions for pages on the site, since our new static generator Hugo defaults to the first 70 characters on the page and that doesn't always provide a good description.
    - Don't forget to check the list of [beginner friendly issues](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22beginner+friendly%22) for issues you're interested in. These are a great way to get started!
  - Check out the [prize details](README.md#prizes).
- Participants can get one point for filling out the [deployment survey](https://go.armory.io/deployment-survey). Armory will also make a charitable donation on your behalf to the charity of your choice when you complete it. The survey is anonymous and does not collect any personal data. The questions were developed by AWS and Armory to get more information about how we can improve experiences in using Spinnaker and integrating it with our products.
