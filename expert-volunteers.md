# Expert Volunteers at Spinnaker Gardening Days

Here are the volunteer role descriptions for Spinnaker Gardening Days Experts. If you would like to volunteer for one of these roles for the Summit Gardening event 10/19-11/12, please post in [#gardening-general](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/archives/CV4A90DPF) on Spinnaker Slack. You can sign up directly for a role or shift on the [sign-up sheet](https://go.armory.io/gardening-experts). If you have any questions, please reach out to @dnilasor on Spinnaker Slack.

### On-Call Gardener (est 3.5 hrs per shift)
The On-Call Gardener volunteers to monitor Slack channels during the gardening event and answer questions from participants. When starting their rotation, the On-Call Gardener will add themselves to the @on-call-gardener Slack Team so that participants can ping a convenient handle with questions. When they're done, they'll leave the team so they don't get pinged unnecessarily. On-call gardeners can provide direct assistance or triage, and so can have engineering expertise or be non-technical.

#### On-Call Gardener Tips
- If you don't know the answer to a question, pull in a fellow Expert that may know. Failing that, point attendees to the appropriate SIG
- Both technical and non-technical volunteers are needed
- Be courteous to the participants! This is often their first experience to the community, and we want to make sure they come back :)
- Check-in to the [#gardening-general](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/archives/CV4A90DPF) and [#gardening-ineedhelp](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/archives/CURFZGL2E) channels ocassionally with a friendly message, so that participants have a face to attach to the questions they ask!

### Team Mentor (est 3 hr per week)
A mentor gardener volunteers to guide a hackathon team in its project from decision to demo. Mentor gardeners will receive team assignments the week of October 19. They should reach out via the team channels in Spinnaker Slack to inquire about project ideas and offer to assist with project selection. After that, at minimum, a mentor gardener should check in with the mentee team every weekday via Slack throughout the event. Virtual meetings are also an option, and we recommend that mentors spend a half an hour with their teams each weekday.

#### Team Mentor Tips
- Set expectations about communication methods and cadence with the team on or before kickoff day (the 19th) and plan some check-ins
- As a mentor gardener, you’re not expected to know everything. You ARE strongly encouraged to familiarize yourself with those that have Spinnaker expertise, and introduce your team to other experts who can assist when you cannot unblock

### Match Advisor (est 2.5 hrs)
A match advisor is responsible for assisting in the formation of teams from hackathon teams based on the skills and interests they share at registration. Match advisors should be available for a half hour orientation discussion the week of October 12th, and for a 2-hour synchronous session on 11/15 or 11/16 to form the teams.
