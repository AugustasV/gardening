### Individual Prize Tiers
Here's what you'll get to play with if your points total crosses these thresholds. You'll earn one point every time you complete an item on [this list](https://spinnaker.io/community/gardening/what-to-hack/). Points will be [tracked here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kt9MJexQTPb1AuC5mQXZBX-NBZf5XsSwBBpy3WJ_fJk/edit?usp=sharing) on the Spinnaker Gardening Days Contributors tab and updated in batches throughout the week. We'll ship your prizes along with your Gardening tshirt. Be patient; shipping is bananaballs right now!

Earn a [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/) for all your projects.  The on-board wireless is a game changer!

#### Hedgehog Hacker = 30 points
