# Spinnaker Gardening Days, our open source hackathon

[Register here](https://go.armory.io/gardening) to join Spinnaker contributors on July 16-23 to learn and build. All contributions you make in the week, including project and plugin code, documentation, content, videos, issues [and more](https://spinnaker.io/community/gardening/what-to-hack/), add up to points. All contributors will receive prizes based on their point totals, so contribute when you can. When you [sign up](https://go.armory.io/gardening), you'll be matched with a team. Teams can choose a project and compete in one of [four challenge categories](https://spinnaker.io/community/gardening/hack-logistics/#team-challenges). Teams that demo a project will be eligible for prize packages awarded to challenge-winning teams and runners-up in each category. 

Elevate your impact with free compute from AWS, SIG projects in Security, Ops, and more, a global-friendly schedule, and updated documentation and training resources. Everyone's welcome to automate the SDLC and extend the ecosystem with us!

## How to participate and earn prizes

Contribute when you can! When you register, you'll be matched with a team. You will receive your team match via [Spinnaker Slack](join.spinnaker.io) by July 15. All contributions you make in a team project count as individual contributions, and demoing a project enters your team to win a challenge prize package, too!

## What is this and why do I care?
This is quickstart documentation for the Spinnaker Gardening Days #communityHack, a series of open-source Spinnaker hackathons open to anyone in the community, including newcomers. The goal of this doc is help you get started participating.

Right now, humans are more isolated than ever; however, we're coming together virtually like never before. The culture of dispersed and asynchronous collaboration at the foundation of open source seems more relevant than ever as we must together rise to a totally overwhelming and frightening global challenge. Spinnaker Gardening Days aims to shine a light of fun and hope into our community. We envision a future of great software delivery bringing us closer to the experiences that matter. 

Let's solve together; you'll have fun, we promise!

## When is the event?
This second event will take place online on July 16th - 23rd, 2020. [Click here](https://go.armory.io/gardening) to register. Tickets are available for the hackathon and dedicated training workshops. 

## Teams and First Timers
This time, team formation is on us. The registration questions will help us to create balanced teams of 2-5. Then, we'll connect you with your teammates on Spinnaker Slack the week on the hackathon. There, you can share your project ideas. Our team of Spinnaker community experts can also help you choose the perfect project, and will be on call to advise you through the week. Consult and collaborate through blockers.

## How should I prepare to participate in Spinnaker Gardening?
1. Register for the event [on Eventbrite](https://go.armory.io/gardening)
2. [Join Spinnaker Slack](https://join.spinnaker.io) and join the following channels:
    * **[#gardening-general](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/archives/CV4A90DPF)**   Make general, public conversation. Please use threads for (welcome!) jokes and side conversations.
    * **[#gardening-ineedhelp](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/archives/CURFZGL2E)**   Request help from experts during the hackathon, or ask setup questions before it starts.
3. Ask your organization to support you in spending time at the event. [Use this flyer](https://s.armory.io/v1ur0KQQ) to highlight the benefits of participating (TL;DR - expert tips, network with fellow Spinnaker devs, free training, exposure for your company).
4. Visit the [Project Ideas Wiki](https://github.com/spinnaker-hackathon/gardening/wiki/Project-Ideas) in the Gardening Wiki tab. 
   * Review the ideas. If you have follow-up ideas, questions, or enthusiasm for an idea, join the listed __#gardening-idea-XXXXXX__ channel in Slack to discuss it.
   * If you have a project idea, follow the instructions to add it. Then, go to Spinnaker Slack and create the Channel Name you specified. 
5. Read the [Plugin Users Guide](https://www.spinnaker.io/guides/user/plugin-users/) to learn about the new plugin framework for Spinnaker. Project teams should strongly consider building extensions and customizations as plugins, to accelerate progress and make projects easier to maintain. Leverage an existing Gradle build and extension points in Spinnaker's microservices. Look out for more in-depth plugin training soon!
6. Leverage our ramp-up materials. We will announce in **#gardening-general** and publish the links on this page when they are available.

## How will you select a winning team?
This is a collaborative hackathon, so there won't be one winning team. However, community awards and **prizes will be given to all teams that present at the Demo**. After the hackathon ends, a community voting period will happen in Spinnaker Slack to select the **Community's Choice Project**. The Community Choice Project will get recognized at Spinnaker Summit in October. 


## Do I need to build something production-ready to participate?
NO! A top goal of this event: build the community and give participants a chance to get to know each other. Your team isn't required to build something that’s fully working. If you get halfway through a project and it no longer makes sense, you will have likely learned a lot and made connections. Stay and hang out! While we're sure to come out with some useful features, fixes, or plugins, this is supposed to be fun. It does not need to be feature complete.

## Should we build our project as a Spinnaker plugin?
Yes, if possible! Read the [Plugin Users Guide](https://www.spinnaker.io/guides/user/plugin-users/) to learn more about how to use and build Spinnaker plugins.

## How can I get involved in Spinnaker Gardening Days as a Spinnaker Expert? What kind of support will experts provide to attendees?
So glad you asked! Here are the volunteer role descriptions for Spinnaker Gardening Days Experts. If you would like to volunteer for one of these roles, please post in [#gardening-general](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/archives/CV4A90DPF) on Spinnaker Slack. 

### On-Call Gardener (est 3.5 hrs per shift)
The On-Call Gardener volunteers to monitor Slack channels during the gardening event and answer questions from participants. When starting their rotation, the On-Call Gardener will add themselves to the @on-call-gardener Slack Team so that participants can ping a convenient handle with questions. When they're done, they'll leave the team so they don't get pinged unnecessarily.

#### On-Call Gardener Tips
- If you don't know the answer to a question, pull in a fellow Expert that may know. Failing that, point attendees to the appropriate SIG
- Be courteous to the participants! This is often their first experience to the community, and we want to make sure they come back :)
- Check-in to the [#gardening-general](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/archives/CV4A90DPF) and [#gardening-ineedhelp](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/archives/CURFZGL2E) channels ocassionally with a friendly message, so that participants have a face to attach to the questions they ask!

### Team Mentor (est 1 hr per weekday)
A mentor gardener volunteers to guide a hackathon team in its project from decision to demo. Mentor gardeners will receive team assignments on June 14. They should reach out via the team channels in Spinnaker Slack to inquire about project ideas and offer to assist with project selection. After that, at minimum, a mentor gardener should check in with the mentee team every weekday via Slack, June 16-17 and 20-23. Zoom meetings are also an option, and we recommend that mentors spend a hour with their teams each weekday.

#### Team Mentor Tips
- Set expectations about communication methods and cadence with the team on or before kickoff day (the 16th) and plan some check-ins
- As a mentor gardener, you’re not expected to know everything. You ARE strongly encouraged to familiarize yourself with those that have Spinnaker expertise, and introduce your team to other experts who can assist when you cannot unblock

### Hands-On Teacher (est 6 hrs)
A hands-on teacher volunteers to guide a group of attendees in a hands-on training that is developer and contributor-focused. Spinnaker Gardening Days Hands-On Classes aim to get newer Spinnaker contributors comfortable in building Spinnaker and Spinnaker plugins. Teachers will prepare or curate content for a session 90 that provides hands-on practice, and deliver that session during Gardening Days. Teachers may need to prepare an environment for students to work through the course content within. Teachers should expect to provide support to students during the class, and on a limited basis after the class during the hackathon. Teachers should be OK with the class being recorded and shared. Asynchronous classes with no support are also possible at Spinnaker Gardening Days, so reach out in [#gardening-general](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/archives/CV4A90DPF) if you'd like to offer one.

### Hands-On Teaching Assistant (est 2.5 hrs)
A hands-on teaching assistant volunteers to support hands-on teachers and attendees during a Spinnaker Gardening Days Hands-On Class. This may include going into breakout rooms with one or more attendees to troubleshoot 1:1 or in smaller groups. Hands-on TAs should be generally familiar with the course material and should reach out to the teacher in advance to sync on content. 

### Match Advisor (est 2.5 hrs)
A match advisor is responsible for assisting in the formation of teams from hackathon teams based on the skills and interests they share at registration. Match advisors must be available for a half hour orientation discussion the week of July 6th, and for a 2-hour synchronous session on Monday afternoon (7/13) or Tuesday morning (7/14) to form the teams.

## To Be Announced:
Look out for a **training schedule** and **training playlists**, a **team and project matching timeline**, a **prize package breakdown**, and more.
