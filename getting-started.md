### Accessing collaboration platforms

1. Enter the Slack workspace and join the [#gardening-general](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/archives/CV4A90DPF) channel. Introduce yourself!
1. [Check in to gardening](https://go.armory.io/gardener-checkin) to be added to the [leaderboard](https://go.armory.io/contributors).
1. Check your email for an invitation to our event area on [Qiqo Chat](https://go.armory.io/summit-garden), where you can attend Kickoff, Global Standup & Office Hours, OSS SDLC Brunch & Learn, and all [Gardening Days events](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/spinnaker-summit/program/schedule/) (bright yellow on the linked calendar). _Note: this is a different platform than is being used for [Spinnaker Summit](https://www.modev.com/spinnaker-summit).

1. Looking to join a team? Check out these suggested steps:
- Check Spinnaker Slack to see if you have been added to a team channel, or received a direct message from a Gardening Admin. If you're in a team channel already, get the conversation going!
- Browse team areas in [Qiqo Chat](https://go.armory.io/summit-garden) to join a team meeting or document.
- Reach out to any teams you're interested in by joining the team Slack channel, which will begin with #gardening-team- , to begin collaborating.

- You can also create a SIG team by showing up at a [SIG meeting](https://github.com/spinnaker/governance) or joining the [Slack channel](http://join.spinnaker.io) of your favorite SIG (channel names begin with ```#sig-```) to propose and discuss a project. Talk about the SIGs' priorities and needs, and identify projects that could be scoped to be completed by mid-November. Reach out in [#gardening-general](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/archives/CV4A90DPF) or recruit from your company if you have ideas and need teammates.
