## Individual Prize Tiers
You'll receive something fun to play with if your points total crosses these thresholds. You'll earn one point every time you complete an item on [this list](https://spinnaker.io/community/gardening/what-to-hack/), and your contributions to team projects count. Points will be [tracked here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kt9MJexQTPb1AuC5mQXZBX-NBZf5XsSwBBpy3WJ_fJk/edit?usp=sharing) on the Spinnaker Gardening Days Contributors tab and updated in batches throughout the week. _FYI: Gaming the points system won't work and will result in disqualification, so please don't try, just have fun with us!_ We'll ship your prizes along with your Gardening Tshirt. Be patient; shipping is bananaballs right now! Prizes sponsored by your friends at Armory.
