# Expert Volunteers at Spinnaker Gardening Days

Here are the volunteer role descriptions for Spinnaker Gardening Days Experts. If you would like to volunteer for one of these roles for the July or October event, please post in [#gardening-general](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/archives/CV4A90DPF) on Spinnaker Slack. You can sign up directly for a role or shift on the [sign-up sheet](https://go.armory.io/gardening-experts).

### On-Call Gardener (est 3.5 hrs per shift)
The On-Call Gardener volunteers to monitor Slack channels during the gardening event and answer questions from participants. When starting their rotation, the On-Call Gardener will add themselves to the @on-call-gardener Slack Team so that participants can ping a convenient handle with questions. When they're done, they'll leave the team so they don't get pinged unnecessarily.

#### On-Call Gardener Tips
- If you don't know the answer to a question, pull in a fellow Expert that may know. Failing that, point attendees to the appropriate SIG
- Be courteous to the participants! This is often their first experience to the community, and we want to make sure they come back :)
- Check-in to the [#gardening-general](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/archives/CV4A90DPF) and [#gardening-ineedhelp](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/archives/CURFZGL2E) channels ocassionally with a friendly message, so that participants have a face to attach to the questions they ask!

### Team Mentor (est 1 hr per weekday)
A mentor gardener volunteers to guide a hackathon team in its project from decision to demo. Mentor gardeners will receive team assignments on June 14. They should reach out via the team channels in Spinnaker Slack to inquire about project ideas and offer to assist with project selection. After that, at minimum, a mentor gardener should check in with the mentee team every weekday via Slack, June 16-17 and 20-23. Zoom meetings are also an option, and we recommend that mentors spend a hour with their teams each weekday.

#### Team Mentor Tips
- Set expectations about communication methods and cadence with the team on or before kickoff day (the 16th) and plan some check-ins
- As a mentor gardener, you’re not expected to know everything. You ARE strongly encouraged to familiarize yourself with those that have Spinnaker expertise, and introduce your team to other experts who can assist when you cannot unblock

### Hands-On Teacher (est 6 hrs)
A hands-on teacher volunteers to guide a group of attendees in a hands-on training that is developer and contributor-focused. Spinnaker Gardening Days Hands-On Classes aim to get newer Spinnaker contributors comfortable in building Spinnaker and Spinnaker plugins. Teachers will prepare or curate content for a session 90 that provides hands-on practice, and deliver that session during Gardening Days. Teachers may need to prepare an environment for students to work through the course content within. Teachers should expect to provide support to students during the class, and on a limited basis after the class during the hackathon. Teachers should be OK with the class being recorded and shared. Asynchronous classes with no support are also possible at Spinnaker Gardening Days, so reach out in [#gardening-general](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/archives/CV4A90DPF) if you'd like to offer one.

### Hands-On Teaching Assistant (est 2.5 hrs)
A hands-on teaching assistant volunteers to support hands-on teachers and attendees during a Spinnaker Gardening Days Hands-On Class. This may include going into breakout rooms with one or more attendees to troubleshoot 1:1 or in smaller groups. Hands-on TAs should be generally familiar with the course material and should reach out to the teacher in advance to sync on content. 

### Match Advisor (est 2.5 hrs)
A match advisor is responsible for assisting in the formation of teams from hackathon teams based on the skills and interests they share at registration. Match advisors must be available for a half hour orientation discussion the week of July 6th, and for a 2-hour synchronous session on Monday afternoon (7/13) or Tuesday morning (7/14) to form the teams.
